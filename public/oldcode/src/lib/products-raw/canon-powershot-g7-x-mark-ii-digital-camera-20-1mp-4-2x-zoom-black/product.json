      "content": "I was honestly kinda freaking out about buying a used camera online. Like, I’m a broke college student and needed something for my photo class, but didn’t wanna drop a ton of cash. This thing showed up literally two days before my first assignment (I was sweating, lol). There’s a little scuff by the shutter button but whatever, it works fine. Took it to my friend’s band show in this super dark basement and the pics were actually way better than my phone. Battery lasted all night too. For the price, I’m honestly surprised. Would totally do it again.",

      "content": "Bought this right before a trip to Joshua Tree because my old camera just died (rip). Wasn’t sure about used stuff but honestly, it looks almost new. There’s a tiny ding on the corner but you gotta look for it. Took some sunrise pics and the colors were awesome. The box was kinda trashed when it got here but the camera was fine. Saved a bunch of money and still got cool shots of my dog climbing rocks.",

      "content": "Just started messing around with photography (mostly for fun, nothing serious) and grabbed this after a friend said it was good. It was packed up nice and ready to go. Took it to a food truck fest and got some cool taco pics—colors looked good even with weird lighting. Only thing is, the touchscreen gets smudgy kinda fast but I just wipe it off. Not a big deal. Glad I didn’t blow a ton on something new.",

      "content": "Shipping was fast, like I blinked and it was at my door. I’ve bought used stuff before and sometimes it’s a gamble, but this camera felt solid right away. No manual in the box (not a big deal, I just googled it), but everything else looked untouched. Took it out for some street shots in Chicago and it handled the weird March weather just fine. The strap was a little frayed so I just used my old one. Would buy here again for sure.",

      "content": "I almost didn’t buy this, honestly. Been burned on used gear before. But I’m glad I did. The G7X was bubble-wrapped like crazy and looked barely touched. First thing I did was snap a pic of my dog to see if it worked—super sharp. Only thing is, the battery drains a little faster than I hoped, but I just got a backup and it’s fine. For what I paid, I’m impressed.",

      "content": "Picked this up for my YouTube channel because my old camera was just too bulky. This one’s way lighter, which is awesome for walking around NYC. The flip screen is super handy, but I wish it was a little brighter in sunlight. Also, the Wi-Fi setup took me a minute to figure out (not super techy, tbh). Still, I filmed a whole day in Central Park and the footage looked crisp—even caught a squirrel stealing my pretzel, lol. Would recommend if you want something easy to carry.",
